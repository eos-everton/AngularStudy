          In the north of Averion, amidst the frozen expanses of Iverskael, lies
          the imposing Gelion Forest. A region where the snow never melts and
          where the cutting winds whisper ancient secrets among the
          silver-branched trees. It is said that this forest is not only a
          refuge for wild animals but also home to ancestral guardians, mystical
          entities that watch over the balance of nature and protect the secrets
          hidden within.
        </p>
        <p>
          Travelers who dare to enter Gelion know that there is no safe path.
          Trails form and disappear with the snowstorms, and the shadows of the
          trees seem to move at will. It is said that under the full moonlight,
          one can see slender figures walking among the trees, their eyes
          shining like distant stars.

          Centuries ago, an ancient people inhabited the borders of Gelion. They
          were known as the Vëlarim, guardians of the forest and keepers of the
          knowledge of the frozen runes. Their leader, Eryon, had such a deep
          connection with the land that he could predict storms and understand
          the whispers of the winds. However, the Vëlarim disappeared long ago,
          leaving only their legends and relics buried beneath the snow.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most told stories is that of the Silver Queen, an entity
          many believe to be the spirit of an ancient guardian of the Vëlarim.
          According to bards, she appears on nights of harsh winter, wrapped in
          a cloak made of snow and light. Those who cross her path say they feel
          a welcoming presence, but also an overwhelming force. Her duty is to
          protect the secrets of Gelion and prevent intruders from desecrating
          what lies hidden in the depths of the forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rumors about what lies at the heart of Gelion vary. Some say there is
          a crystallized city where time has stopped and the spirits of the
          ancients still wander. Others believe that a powerful artifact rests
          beneath the roots of a colossal tree, capable of granting dominion
          over eternal winter. Many adventurers have tried to find such wonders,
          but few have returned to tell the tale.

          Among those who returned, one name stands out: Kaelen, a relic hunter
          who claims to have seen the Silver Queen and walked through forgotten
          ruins. He carries with him a fragment of blue-icy crystal that glows
          under the moonlight and emits an almost imperceptible sound, like a
          distant whisper calling for a return to the forest. Kaelen knows that
          his journey is not yet over and that the secrets of Gelion still await
          those brave enough to uncover them.
